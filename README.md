# Student Data
## Overview
We were provided student information across a number of public and charter schools. The data included the student's grade, their math/reading score and the budget for each school. The purpose of this activity was to collect, prepare and analyze the data.

## Results
I discovered that the scores for math do not increase as the student gets to higher grade levels. In fact, the math scores were highest on average in the first year for both charter and public schools. Based on the calculations we performed, there is not a noted driver for this decline. I also learned that the average budget of charter vs public schools does not correlate to the average scores in math. During grades 9-11, charter schools outperform ppublic schools, but in grade 12, public out performs charter.

## Next Steps
It would be worthwhile to analyze the budget based on the total number of students at each school to see if that correlates to  the reading and math scores. We should first create a new column to show what the budget is per student (school_budget/Total_Students) and then see how the per student budget relates to the scores. I would want to chart the per student budget (x-axis) vs the reading and math scores to see visually how they relate.
